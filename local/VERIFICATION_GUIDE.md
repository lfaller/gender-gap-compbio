# Quick Gender Verification Guide

Instead of 100 random names, let's focus on the ones that matter:
**Verification Priority:** Names that appear multiple times (more likely real researchers)

## Strategy for Quick Verification

For each name:
1. Google the name + 'researcher' or 'professor'
2. Look for: University profile, ResearchGate, ORCID, Twitter bio
3. Estimate gender from: pronouns, first name patterns, photos/bios
4. Enter: M, F, or ? if ambiguous

## Names Worth Verifying (appear 2+ times)
