# We Updated the 2017 Study on Women in Computational Biology

In 2017, Bonham & Stefan found women made up just 21% of last authors in computational biology. Eight years later, I replicated the analysis with a decade of new data (2015–2025).

**The progress:** Female representation grew from 37.3% → 42.3%. That's **10x faster** than the pace before 2017. 📈

**The persistent gap:**
- First authors: 45% female ✓
- Last authors (PI proxy): 31% female ✗
- **Seniority gap: 14.5 points**

We've improved representation in junior positions but haven't closed the leadership pipeline.

**The bright spot:** Papers with female last authors have more female co-authors across all positions. Women in power are actively lifting up other women. 💪

**What COVID taught us:** Rather than disrupting progress, we saw a *continuation* of the upward trend through 2020-2021. Intentional work on diversity and inclusion works.
