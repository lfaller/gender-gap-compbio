# I Updated a 2017 Study on Women in Computational Biology. Here's What 10 More Years of Data Shows.

*In 2017, a landmark study found that women made up just 21% of last authors in computational biology papers. We wanted to know: has that changed?*

## The Finding That Started It All

In 2017, Bonham and Stefan published a pivotal paper showing that computational biology lagged biology overall in female authorship. Their conclusion was stark: women were underrepresented, and at the current pace of change, closing the gap would take *decades*.

Eight years later, with a decade of new data now available, I decided to replicate their analysis. The results surprised me.

## What I Found

I analyzed 274,702 papers and nearly 1 million unique authors from 2015 to 2025. Here's what stood out:

**Female representation in computational biology has grown from 37.3% (2015) to 42.3% (2025).**

That's 5 percentage points in 10 years, a pace roughly **10 times faster** than what we observed before 2017. Progress is accelerating.

But there's a catch.

When I break down by author position, the picture is more nuanced. First authors are 45% female. Last authors (the presumed senior investigators) are only 31% female. **The seniority gap is real.**

One bright spot: papers with female last authors consistently have more female co-authors across all positions. Women in power in computational biology are actively lifting up other women. That matters.

## The Pandemic Question

Did COVID-19 disrupt gender representation in science? Our data suggests the opposite. We saw a *continuation* of the upward trend through 2020-2021 and into recovery. If anything, the momentum accelerated.

## Why This Matters

These numbers describe something concrete: who gets published, who gets credited, who leads research teams. It's not the whole story; authorship doesn't capture the full workforce, and name-based gender analysis has real limitations. But it's an important signal.

I validated the approach by manually classifying 100 unclassifiable names through web searches. Result: the unknowns are 56% male (vs 53% in our classified set), suggesting they don't systematically bias our findings. The position gap holds up under scrutiny.

The acceleration tells us something hopeful: intentional work on diversity and inclusion works. The gap tells us where work remains.

## What's Next

If you're interested in the full methodology, data, and figures, the analysis is open-source and reproducible on GitHub. If you're in computational biology, I'm curious about your experience; share your thoughts in the comments.

And if you're in bioinformatics or adjacent fields, consider taking the Boston Women in Bioinformatics community survey. We need more than aggregate statistics; we need to hear directly from you about barriers, support systems, and what success looks like.

Progress isn't inevitable; it's something we build together.
