**Audience:** Researchers, developers, students wanting to reproduce or extend the work

**Purpose:** Technical, reproducible write-up that establishes rigor and enables others to build on your work.

**Current README includes:**
- Project motivation and connection to Bonham & Stefan 2017
- Quick-start instructions with code examples
- Complete methodology (data sources, gender inference, statistical analysis)
- Key findings with figures
- Methodological limitations (transparent and detailed)
- Architecture section explaining the SQLite database approach
- Contribution guidelines

**Distribution:**
- Primary: GitHub repository
- Secondary: Include link in blog post and LinkedIn article
- Potential: Can be cited directly in academic contexts

---

## 📊 Key Figures to Include

### For Blog Post:
1. **Figure 2 (Temporal Trend)**: Line chart showing P(female) 2015-2025, with annotation for COVID period
   - Why: Most intuitive for non-specialist audience, shows the upward trend clearly
   - Format: PNG for web, SVG for high-resolution

2. **Figure 1 (Position Breakdown)**: Bar chart comparing first/second/middle/penultimate/last author positions
   - Why: Illustrates the persistence of position gaps; tells the story of seniority disparity
   - Format: PNG for web, SVG for print

3. **Figure 3 (COVID-19 Impact)**: Three-bar chart showing pre-COVID, pandemic, recovery
   - Why: Addresses timely question about pandemic's effect on gender representation
   - Format: PNG for web, SVG for print

### For LinkedIn:
- **Figure 2 (Temporal Trend only)**: Embedded as a single visual
  - Why: LinkedIn favors single, clear visual; keeps article clean and scannable
  - Format: High-quality PNG (1200x600px recommended)

## 🎯 Expected Reach & Engagement

### Blog Post:
- **Expected reach:** 500-2,000 views (BWIB community + SEO over time)

## 🔄 Long-Term Strategy

### Content Repurposing:
1. Create a 2-3 minute explainer video walking through findings (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
2. Design an infographic summarizing key numbers
3. Develop a medium-form piece for Science Magazine or Nature Careers (if interested in academic audience)
4. Thread summarizing findings on Twitter/X

### Engagement & Response:
- Monitor comments on blog post and LinkedIn article
- Respond thoughtfully to questions and critical feedback
- Update blog post if errors are identified or new context emerges
- Use feedback to inform future updates to analysis

### Citation & Referencing:
- Make the GitHub repo citable (add DOI via Zenodo)
- Create a bibtex entry for your own work
- Track who cites/uses your analysis

---

## 📝 Optional Extensions

### For Academic Audience:
If you want to reach researchers and academics more formally, consider:
- **Short methods paper:** 5-10 page paper in *F1000 Research* (open access, quick publication)
- **Preprint:** Post on bioRxiv before/after blog publication
- **Data paper:** Publish the dataset itself as a citable artifact

### For Media/Podcast:
- Pitch to science journalists covering STEM diversity
- Reach out to bioinformatics/science podcasts for an interview
- Propose a panel discussion at an upcoming conference

## 📧 Sample Email to BWIB

Subject: Ready to Publish: "Where Do We Stand?" (2025 Gender Representation Update)

Hi [BWIB Editor/Leadership],

I've completed the analysis of gender representation in computational biology (2015-2025), replicating Bonham & Stefan 2017. I have three publication-ready pieces:

1. **BWIB Deep Dive Blog Post** (1,600 words): comprehensive, accessible, community-focused
2. **LinkedIn Article** (550 words): short form for professional networks
3. **GitHub Repository** (code + data + technical docs): for researchers

Key findings:
- Female representation grew from 37.3% (2015) to 42.3% (2025), a 10x faster pace than pre-2017
- Position gap persists: first authors 45% female, last authors 31% female
- Female PI effect confirmed: women in senior positions recruit/support women at earlier stages
- COVID-19 period showed *acceleration*, not disruption, in upward trend

The analysis directly supports BWIB's community survey and mentorship programs. I'd like to publish the blog post in early March, coordinated with [upcoming BWIB campaign/event].

Would you be available this week to review the draft and discuss publication timing?

Best,
Lina
