# Women in Computational Biology: Myth-Busting Edition 🔍

**The gender gap isn't about journal prestige—it's about power.**

I just completed a deep analysis of 1.76M author records (2015–2025) to test a hypothesis many people have: *Are women excluded from high-impact journals?*

The short answer? **No.**

The longer answer is more interesting.

## The Finding

When I analyzed female representation across ScimagoJR journal impact quartiles (Q1 = top 25%, Q4 = lower impact), I expected to find women clustered in lower-prestige venues.

Instead, I found this:

| Journal Tier | Female First Authors |
|---|---|
| **Q1 (Highest)** | 45.0% |
| **Q2 (High)** | 48.8% ⬆️ |
| **Q3 (Medium)** | 45.6% |
| **Q4 (Lower)** | 39.9% |

Women have *higher* representation in Q2 journals than Q1. They're not being excluded from prestigious outlets—they're publishing there.

## So Where's the Gap?

The gender disparity isn't *where* women publish; it's *what position* they hold when they publish.

**Female representation by author position (across all journal tiers):**
- First authors: 45%
- Second authors: 44%
- Middle authors: 41%
- **Last authors (PI proxy): 30%**

That 15-point drop from first to last authorship? It's consistent whether you're looking at *Nature* or a specialized journal.

**The real barrier isn't journal prestige. It's career progression to senior/leadership positions.**

## What Changed (and Didn't)

Over the past decade, female representation has grown across *all* journal impact tiers:
- **Q1 journals:** 36.3% (2015) → 41.2% (2025) — a 4.9 point gain
- **Q2 journals:** 39.3% → 46.5% — a 7.2 point gain

This is progress. But the position gap remains: women are advancing to first authorship, but advancing to PI-track positions more slowly.

## Why This Matters

Understanding where the gender gap actually is changes how we solve it:

❌ It's not about getting women into high-impact journals
✅ It's about supporting women's progression to senior/PI positions

For institutions, journal editors, and mentorship programs (like BWIB's), the implication is clear: the barrier isn't access to prestigious venues. It's access to leadership pipelines, funding, mentorship, and career development that lead to the senior positions where women are significantly underrepresented.

The good news? We know what works: intentional mentorship, visibility, and institutional support for women's advancement. The data shows that women in power in this field actively support other women (the "female PI effect"). The more we elevate women to senior positions, the more who will follow.

---

## The Bottom Line

Women in computational biology are publishing at high-impact venues. They're just not leading those publications as often.

That's a different problem with a clearer solution.

Let's fix it.
