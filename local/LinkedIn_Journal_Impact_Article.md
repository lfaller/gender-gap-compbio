# Myth-Busting: Do Women Publish in Lower-Impact Journals? 🔍

I analyzed 1.76M author records to test something many assume: *Are women excluded from high-impact journals?*

**Short answer:** No.

**The data:**

| Journal Tier | Female First Authors |
|---|---|
| Q1 (Highest) | 45.0% |
| **Q2 (High)** | **48.8%** ⬆️ |
| Q3 (Medium) | 45.6% |
| Q4 (Lower) | 39.9% |

Women have *higher* representation in Q2 than Q1. They're not excluded from prestigious venues—they're publishing there at equal or greater rates.

**So where's the gap?**

The issue isn't WHERE women publish—it's WHAT POSITION they hold:
- First authors: 45% female
- **Last authors (PI proxy): 30% female**
- **15-point gap that holds across all journal tiers**

**The insight:** The gender gap isn't about journal prestige. It's about career progression to senior leadership positions.

Women advance to first authorship. But advancing to PI-track positions? That's slower.

**Why this matters:** We can stop worrying about getting women into high-impact journals (they're already there). Focus instead on building pathways to leadership and senior positions.
