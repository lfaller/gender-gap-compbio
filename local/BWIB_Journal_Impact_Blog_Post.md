## The Second Question

In my previous deep dive, I shared an encouraging finding: female representation in computational biology authorship is improving, from 37.3% (2015) to 42.3% (2025). But this raised a natural follow-up question, one that I suspect many of you have wondered:

**If women are underrepresented as first and last authors, are they at least publishing in high-impact journals? Or are they clustered in lower-prestige venues?**

It's a fair question—and the answer surprised me.

## The Research Question

Here's what researchers often call a "secondary gender gap": Beyond position disparities, do female authors face barriers to publishing in prestigious journals?

This matters because journal prestige affects visibility, citations, funding opportunities, and career advancement. If women were systematically excluded from *Nature*, *Science*, *PNAS*, and other top-tier journals, that would be an additional layer of disadvantage on top of the authorship position gap we already documented.

So I analyzed **1.76 million author-position records** (2015–2025) and mapped each publication to its journal's impact ranking using **ScimagoJR quartiles**:
- **Q1:** Top 25% (highest impact) — *Nature*, *Science*, *PNAS*, *Bioinformatics*
- **Q2:** 25–50% (high impact)
- **Q3:** 50–75% (medium impact)
- **Q4:** 75–100% (lower impact)

Then I tested: Does female representation (P_female) differ across these tiers?

## The Counterintuitive Finding: No Journal Impact Gap

Here's the result that I'm still digesting:

**Female representation is remarkably consistent across journal impact tiers, and in some cases, women have *higher* representation in higher-impact journals.**

Breaking down female representation by position and journal quartile:

| Position | Q1 (Highest) | Q2 (High) | Q3 (Medium) | Q4 (Lower) |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **First Author** | 45.0% | **48.8%** ⬆️ | 45.6% | 39.9% |
| **Second Author** | 42.8% | **46.7%** ⬆️ | 44.5% | 41.3% |
| **Middle Positions** | 40.5% | 44.1% | 43.7% | 43.1% |
| **Last Author** | 30.0% | **33.8%** ⬆️ | 33.7% | 26.5% |

Notice what's happening here: **Q2 journals show higher female representation across almost every author position.** Female first authors in Q2 journals are 48.8%—nearly half! Compare that to Q1 (45.0%) or Q4 (39.9%).

*Figure 1: P(Female) by Journal Quartile and Author Position. The red dashed line indicates 50% parity. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Notably, Q2 journals show higher female representation across most positions, and female representation is not lower in Q4 (lower-impact) journals than in Q1 (highest-impact) journals.*

This is the *opposite* of what I expected. If women were systematically excluded from top-tier venues, I would expect to see higher female representation in Q4. Instead, we see the opposite.

## What This Tells Us

**The gender gap in computational biology is not about journal prestige. It's about authorship position.**

Women are publishing in high-impact journals at rates proportional to (or sometimes higher than) men. The inequality we documented in my previous analysis—the ~14-point gap between first and last authorship—is consistent across impact tiers. It's not that women are relegated to lower-prestige venues; it's that when women do publish, they're less likely to be the first author or the senior/corresponding author, regardless of the journal's impact.

This is an important distinction because it changes how we think about the problem:
- It's not about women being excluded from prestigious outlets
- It's about women being excluded from lead and senior positions, whether the venue is *Nature* or a specialized domain journal
- The barrier isn't journal selection; it's career progression and seniority

## A Decade of Progress Across All Tiers

When I looked at female representation over time (2015–2025) across journal quartiles, I found consistent improvement:

**Female representation in Q1 journals:**
- 2015: 36.3%
- 2020: 38.8%
- 2025: 41.2%
- **Gain: +4.9 percentage points**

**Female representation in Q2 journals:**
- 2015: 39.3%
- 2020: 42.7%
- 2025: 46.5%
- **Gain: +7.2 percentage points**

**Female representation in Q3 journals:**
- 2015: 39.0%
- 2020: 42.6%
- 2025: 45.8%
- **Gain: +6.8 percentage points**

This upward trend is encouraging and consistent. Women aren't just gaining ground in total authorship; they're gaining ground *across all impact tiers*.

*Figure 2: Distribution of Female vs. Male Authors Across Journal Quartiles. This stacked bar chart shows what proportion of female vs. male authors' papers are published in each journal tier. The percentage labels show the distribution clearly. Note that female authors are not disproportionately represented in Q4 (lower-impact) journals.*

## A Note on Publication Lag

Here's something important to understand: the papers published in 2024–2025 represent scientific work conducted in 2021–2023. When we observe improvements in our most recent data, we're actually seeing the fruits of work done during and shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic, not the current state of the field.

This is crucial for interpretation. The apparent acceleration in female representation in 2023–2025 data is real—but it reflects decisions, submissions, and editorial work from 1–3 years ago. The true current state of gender representation in computational biology (reflecting 2024–2025 work) remains partially hidden in the publication pipeline.

What does this mean? The improvements we see are genuine, but we should be cautious about extrapolating too far into the future. Real changes happening right now won't be visible in published literature for another couple of years.

## So Where Are the Barriers?

If women aren't excluded from prestigious journals, where *is* the gender gap?

The answer is clear from the data: **authorship position and seniority**.

- Women are publishing at high rates in top journals (45% of first authors in Q1)
- But they're significantly less likely to be in senior/PI positions (30% of last authors in Q1)
- This gap holds across all journal impact levels

This suggests the barriers are in:
1. **Career progression pathways** — Women advance to PI status more slowly or less often
2. **Lab leadership and recruitment** — Women PIs (the female PI effect notwithstanding) represent only ~30% of senior investigators
3. **Institutional support** — Mentorship, funding, and promotion pathways that support the transition from early-career to senior positions

These are systemic issues that can't be fixed by journal policy alone. They require institutional change, funding agency attention, and intentional mentorship and support programs.

## What This Means for BWIB

Our work on visibility, mentorship, and career development takes on renewed significance. The data tells us that women *can and do* publish in top venues. The barrier isn't access to prestigious outlets; it's access to the senior positions that come with sustained career momentum.

This is exactly where BWIB's leadership development initiatives, mentorship programs, and visibility campaigns add value. We're not fighting to get women into high-impact journals—they're already there. We're fighting to ensure they have the support, visibility, and pathways to become the PIs, senior researchers, and lab leaders of tomorrow.

The female PI effect—the fact that women in power in this field actively support other women—tells us something hopeful: the more women we elevate to senior positions, the more women at earlier career stages benefit.

## An Invitation

If you're curious about the methodology or want to explore the data yourself, the analysis is open-source on GitHub. And if you're a woman in computational biology navigating the path to senior leadership, BWIB's mentorship program and leadership development initiatives are here to support you.

Progress isn't automatic. But the data shows us that intentional work on diversity, equity, and inclusion—in journals, institutions, and communities like BWIB—creates measurable change.

We're not done. But we're moving in the right direction.

## How We Did This

We analyzed **1.76 million author-position records** from **274,702 PubMed publications** (2015–2025) across both Biology and Computational Biology datasets. Each publication was mapped to a journal impact quartile using **ScimagoJR rankings** via fuzzy string matching (85.7% success rate). Female representation (P_female) for each quartile-position combination was estimated using **bootstrap resampling** with 1,000 iterations per group, with 95% confidence intervals calculated as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.

The temporal analysis tracked female representation across journal quartiles year-by-year, revealing consistent improvements and publication lag effects.
